### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Victoria,
I am a Service Desk Administrator by day and a Computer Science student specializing in Networking and Security by night. When I'm not tackling homework, you'll probably find me playing video games, although,  I'm not very good at it lol.  My favorite is Stardew Valley. I'm also a big fan of anime and enjoy binge watching shows and movies in my free time. Always up for a chat about cats and anime recommendations!
